# CS50W Capstone (Final Project)

## About Project

This Web Application is about helping students connect with activities which align with the student's interests

The Activities can be of following types:

* Organizing an event and letting users participate 
* Finding a Study Partner or Sports partner
* A WebPage of an Activity dedicated to the discussions of certain subjects

The Students can create a range of activities of the above mentioned types and much more which caters to their specific needs

The Author of the Activity holds some previleges which allows them to:

* Delete a message made on an activity if the message contents made by a participating student seem inappropriate
* Kick a User out of an Activity if their behaviour is improper
* Ban the user from interacting with an activity if the User makes the other participants uncomfortable 

## Why I believe this Project Satisfies the Distinctiveness and Complexity mentioned in the Capstone requirements

### Distinctiveness 

1. This Web Application is different from a social network in the following respects:

* The thing that makes a social network a social network is that the users can post anything that's on their mind (as long as they're respectful) (Take Twitter for example or some other social network), The user is not confined to post only posts that satisfy specific requirements,  they can post anything that's on their mind no matter what the subject of the post happens to be. This Web Application on the other hand lets you interact with activites created by other students or deparments of a university. The Activity needs to be well defined as to what it is, An Activity can be a discussion on a specific subject where the users can clarify a range of doubts they have on a specific part of that subject, or an Activity can be an event where the organizing team of the activity can define what an activity is and let the users to participate in the activity and answer student's questions if they happen to have any, or an Activity can be a place where you can meet like minded people for a sporting event or for a study partner. I think these reasons make my application differ from a social network.

2. The Web applicaiton should not resemble an ecommerce

### Complexity

This Web Application is fairly complex given the instructions in the Capstone requirements
